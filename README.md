### 1. Introduction 

Shell scripting in Ubuntu is a powerful tool for automating tasks, managing
files, and conducting data science experiments. This document provides a com-
prehensive guide, including practical examples related to AI applications.

### 2. Prerequisites

Ensure you have Ubuntu installed, access to a terminal, and basic familiarity
with Linux commands. Knowledge of AI and machine learning concepts is also
beneficial.

### 3. Creating a shell script
**3.1 Using a Text Editor**
You can use text editors like Vim, Nano, or Gedit. For instance, to create a
script with Nano, type:

`nano mt_script.sh                                                                                                       
`
### 3.2 The Shebang Line
Start your script with a shebang (#!/bin/bash) to specify the interpreter for
running your script.

`#!/bin/bash                                                                      `                                                                                                                                                       `
